Hand Cricket — A simple terminal-based hand-cricket game written in Python.

Overview of the project

This is a small, interactive terminal/console game that simulates a simplified version of hand cricket. The user chooses to bat or bowl in the toss, then plays against the computer. Each delivery, the player inputs a number between 1 and 6; the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 6. If the numbers match, the batting side loses a wicket; otherwise, runs are added to the batting side's total. The match consists of two innings.

Features

Computer randomly bowls or bats using Python's random module.
Wickets and ball counts are tracked.
Two-innings match (each "inning" limited by balls/wickets as per the script).
Simple win/lose output at the end.
